# MRVNLFG

Welcome to the new and improved MRVNLFG!

I have rewritten the bot in TypeScript for use with NodeJS.
Currently only NodeJS version 12.4 and 10.16.3 are verified as working.

## What is MRVNLFG?
MRVNLFG is a LFG bot i originally wrote for the Apex Legends Discord but have made public and open-source since.  
It combines standard LFG functionality with more niche features such as emotes and channel shrinking.  
Moderators also benefit from the [commands](https://github.com/DarkView/JS-MRVNLFG/blob/master/docs/COMMANDS.md) this bot has, as it allows them to quickly locate any user on the server and follow them around.
