# MRVNLFG - NodeJS

Welcome to the new and improved MRVNLFG!

I have rewritten the bot in TypeScript for use with NodeJS.

Currently only NodeJS version 12.4 and 10.16.3 are verified as working.

Detailed instructions for setup will follow soon, for now just use
> npm ci

and use your preferred tools to run the index.js file.

You will need to put your Bot Token into the bot.env file.
