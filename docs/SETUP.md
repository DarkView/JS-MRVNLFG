# **Bot Setup** <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarkView/JS-MRVNLFG/master/docs/MRVN.png" height="32">
*Note:* You need to host this bot yourself! To keep it online 24/7 you need to keep the process running

## First Steps
1. Create a bot account in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/)
2. Invite the created bot to your server with this [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=11281). Replace BOT_ID in your browser with your bots UserID
3. Install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/)
    - NodeJS version 12.4 and 10.16.3 are verified as working.
4. Get the latest bot version [here](https://github.com/DarkView/JS-MRVNLFG/releases) and extract it. The correct zip follows this namescheme: `NodeMRVN-version.zip`
5. In the extracted files, copy and rename the `bot.env.example` to `bot.env`. Open it and replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TOKEN` with your bot token (Not the UserID)

After you are done with the above steps, continue to [configuration](https://github.com/DarkView/JS-MRVNLFG/blob/master/docs/CONFIG.md)
